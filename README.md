## General Information:
This is a Multiple Linear regression project that predicts the demand for rental bikes.The model is based on algorithms like OLS and RFE.

### Problem statement:
A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic.
The company has contacted a consulting firm and wants to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. 
They want to know:
- Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
- How well those variables describe the bike demands

### Business Objective:
Based on various meteorological surveys and people's styles, the service provider firm has gathered a large dataset on daily bike demands.

- As the consulting firm, you need to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables.
- It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features.
- They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations.
- Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.
  
## Technologies Used:
Python - version 3.11.8
Pandas - version 2.2.1
Matplotlib,Seaborn
ScikitLearn 
Statsmodels.api
Jupyter notebook

## Conclusions
- Temp, windspeed, holiday, yr are some of the top features that govern the demand for rental bikes 
- R-score for train set -> 0.83 or 83% 
- R-score for test set -> 0.79 or 79% 
- Therefore,we can say that our model has done a good job at predicting demand for bikes
